# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.

1. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: this is when instead of putting an object together we are taking it appart.

  Researched answer: is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct variables.



2. What are the three arguments that .map() can accept?

  Your answer: since .map is looking at each indeex individualy i would think that it accepts more than three arguments. ok, i am wrong

  Researched answer: value, index, array 



3. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: class is a collection of something while the object is the collection of classes and can have method

  Researched answer: i am so wrong. it is the other way aroud



4. What is the difference between a HTML div and a span?
 
  Your answer: i actually hav never used a span. but i would say no difference. i would say a div wraps a huge block of code into one. imaybe span does the same thing only in react...

  Researched answer: The difference between span and div is that a span element is in-line and usually used for a small chunk of HTML inside a line (such as inside a paragraph) whereas a div (division) element is block-line (which is basically equivalent to having a line-break before and after it) and used to group larger chunks of code.

5. What is React.Fragment and why would you want to use it?
  
  Your answer: i would say that it is as a div in html
  
  Researched answer:  common pattern in React is for a component to return multiple elements. Fragments let you group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM.

6. What are three options for creating responsive design?

  Your answer: if this is about a different size of the screen fit than i would say one is through css, the other one is creating 2 different sites for the phone and the web, the third... use flex box

  Researched answer: i found a lot of info on how to flex it in css. 



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week
- Object oriented programming - 
        Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", 
        which can contain data, in the form of fields, and code, in the form of procedures. 
        A feature of objects is an object's procedures that can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated.
- irb
        Interactive Ruby Shell is a REPL for programming in the object-oriented scripting language Ruby. 
        The abbreviation irb is a portmanteau of the word "interactive" and the filename extension for Ruby files, ".rb".
- Instance variable
        In object-oriented programming with classes, an instance variable is a variable defined in a class, 
        for which each instantiated object of the class has a separate copy, or instance. 
        An instance variable is similar to a class variable.
- Ruby hash
        A Hash is a dictionary-like collection of unique keys and their values. 
        Also called associative arrays, they are similar to Arrays, 
        but where an Array uses integers as its index, a Hash allows you to use any object type.
- Class relationships
        Three important relationships in Ruby are known as ‘belongs to…’, ‘has many…’, 
        and “has many of each other”. The ‘belongs to’ and ‘has many’ relationships are considered to be the inverse of one another. 
        In order to fully understand these various types of object/class relationships, 
        they must be understood both in pseudocode and what the relationships look like programmatically.
